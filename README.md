# MEANStackStudy
Study About Mongo DB + Express js + Angular js + Node js</br>

## What is 'MEAN'?
MEAN Stack is one of the program set for web developing.</br>
Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular JS, and Node JS.</br>
All of them are open source, and using javascript language.</br>

### 1. Node JS
Node JS makes javascript execute without browser.</br>
So we can develop back-end server program with script using Node JS.</br>
* Listen to requests and send responses.</br>
* Execute server-side logic.</br>
* Interact with databases and files.</br>
An alternative to 'PHP', 'Ruby on Rails', 'java' etc.</br>

### 2. Express JS
Express JS is framework that helps us to develop Node JS easily.</br>
In other words, Express JS is a Node framework which simplifies writing server-side code and logic.</br>
* Based on node, offers same functionalities.</br>
* Middleware-based : funnel requests through functions.</br>
* Includes routing, view-rendering & more etc.</br>
> funnel : 이동시키다.</br>

### 3. Mongo DB
Mongo DB is NoSQL, Non Relational Database.</br>
It doen't have table, row, column structure.</br>
Instead of that, Mongo DB save data using 'document', likes object in javascript.</br>
Documents are easily added or deleted.</br>
We can manage data with using javascript without SQL.</br>
Mongo DB is useful when saving dynamic size of data. ex) string or image(base64)</br>
* Store application data. (Users, Products...)</br>
* Enforces no data schema or relations.</br>
* Easily connected to Node & Express. (But not to angular)</br>

### 4. Angular JS
Angular JS is framework for makeing SPA(Single Page Application) at front-end(Client-Side / Browser).</br>
* Render UI with dynamic data</br>
* Handle user input</br>
* Communicate with backend services</br>
It provieds a "Mobile App" like user experience.</br>
It uses javascript as programming language, but could be difficult to use it as a first time.</br>
